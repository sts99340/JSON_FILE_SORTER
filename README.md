# SAM JSON Label Sorter

This Python script organizes JSON files generated by a **SAM (Segment Anything Model)**-based pipeline into separate folders based on the **labels (categories)** present in each file. It helps you manage and sort segmentation output files by grouping them into folders named after the labels they contain.

If a JSON file has **multiple labels**, it will be copied into **each corresponding folder**. If no label is found, it will be placed in an `unlabeled` folder.

## ðŸ“‚ Example Structure

Given a folder of JSON files like:

project/
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ file1.json
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ file2.json
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ file3.json

After running the script, you'll get:

project/
â”œâ”€â”€ categorized/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ cat/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ file1.json
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ dog/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ file2.json
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ unlabeled/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ file3.json
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ file1.json
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ file2.json
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ file3.json
